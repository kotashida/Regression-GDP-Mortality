Overview
This project explores the correlation between child mortality rates and GDP per capita (PPP) for various countries. By analyzing these variables, the goal is to understand the relationship between a country's wealth and its child mortality rate.

The project uses R for data processing, reshaping, and visualization. The dataset is sourced from the World Bank, containing information on GDP per capita (PPP) and child mortality rates across different years for numerous countries.

Datasets
GDP per capita (PPP): A dataset that includes GDP per capita data adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP).
Infant Mortality Rate: A dataset that contains the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births.

Both datasets were downloaded from the World Bank and include data from the year 1960 onwards.

Requirements
R (version 4.0 or later)
Packages: ggplot2, tidyr, readr

Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates the general trend that countries with higher GDP per capita (PPP) tend to have lower infant mortality rates, although there may be variations based on other socioeconomic factors.
